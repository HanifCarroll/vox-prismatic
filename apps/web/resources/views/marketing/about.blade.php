            <h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold text-zinc-900">Built for people who share ideas every day</h1>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-zinc-600">Vox Prismatic exists to help founders, operators, consultants, creators, and community builders turn their experience into consistent, high-quality LinkedIn content.</p>
            <div class="mt-12 space-y-8 text-sm leading-7 text-zinc-600">
                <p>We’ve spent years writing playbooks for personal branding and ghostwriting. The most common blocker is time: keeping up with thoughtful LinkedIn posts while running a business is unsustainable. Vox Prismatic automates the heavy lifting while protecting the human voice that makes your perspective resonate.</p>
                <p>The product is currently in closed beta. We’re onboarding small cohorts to fine-tune the workflow, integrate deeper with LinkedIn, and build the analytics you need to measure impact.</p>
                <p>If you want to amplify your ideas without outsourcing your voice, we’d love to hear from you. Join the waitlist or reach out at <a href="mailto:hello@voxprismatic.com" class="font-medium text-zinc-900 hover:underline">hello@voxprismatic.com</a>.</p>
