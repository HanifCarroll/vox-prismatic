# Post Type Examples

This document demonstrates how the 5 post types work with real examples.

## 1. Problem Post
**Purpose**: Build empathy by relating to audience pain points

### Example Insight:
- **Title**: "Users Abandoning Cart Due to Confusing Checkout"
- **Quote**: "We were losing 70% of users at checkout because they couldn't understand if shipping was included"
- **Summary**: Cart abandonment was killing conversions due to unclear pricing display

### Generated Post:
```
Your checkout page is probably losing you money right now.

I just reviewed a SaaS with a 70% cart abandonment rate. The culprit? Users couldn't tell if shipping was included in the price.

They'd get to checkout, see a number, and bail because they didn't trust it.

The fix was embarrassingly simple: Add "shipping included" next to the price.

Result: Cart abandonment dropped to 35% in one week.

Your users aren't stupid. They're just cautious with their money.

Make your pricing crystal clear or watch them leave.

## 2. Proof Post
**Purpose**: Build credibility by showcasing results

### Example Insight:
- **Title**: "Reduced Support Tickets by 60% with Better Onboarding"
- **Quote**: "After redesigning onboarding, support tickets dropped from 150/week to 60/week"
- **Summary**: Strategic onboarding redesign dramatically reduced support burden

### Generated Post:
```
Cut support tickets by 60% with one simple change.

Client was drowning in 150 support tickets per week. All asking the same basic questions.

We redesigned their onboarding flow:
• Added interactive tutorials
• Created contextual help tooltips  
• Built a "quick wins" checklist

Three weeks later: 60 tickets per week.

That's 90 hours of support time saved. Every. Single. Week.

**The lesson:** Every support ticket is a UX failure you can fix.

Stop treating symptoms. Fix the root cause.

## 3. Framework Post
**Purpose**: Build authority by teaching methodology

### Example Insight:
- **Title**: "The 3-Touch Activation Framework"
- **Quote**: "We use a 3-touch framework: first value in 3 minutes, first win in 3 hours, first habit in 3 days"
- **Summary**: Systematic approach to user activation that builds engagement progressively

### Generated Post:
```
The 3-Touch Activation Framework I use with every client:

**3 Minutes → First Value**
Show them something useful immediately. No setup. No configuration. Just value.

**3 Hours → First Win** 
Guide them to complete one meaningful action. Make them feel successful.

**3 Days → First Habit**
Get them to return voluntarily. Create a reason to come back.

Example: Project management tool
• 3 min: Show their email tasks imported
• 3 hours: Complete first project setup
• 3 days: Daily standup reminder

This framework has improved activation rates by 40%+ across 12 different products.

Copy it. It works.

## 4. Contrarian Take (NEW)
**Purpose**: Generate debate and position as original thinker

### Example Insight:
- **Title**: "Stop Listening to All User Feedback"
- **Quote**: "Half our users wanted dark mode, but building it would've delayed the core features by 2 months"
- **Summary**: Being selective about user feedback led to faster, more focused product development

### Generated Post:
```
Everyone says "listen to your users."

I say that's how you build a bloated mess.

A client had 50 feature requests from their first 100 users. They were planning to build them all.

I killed 47 of them.

Why? Because users ask for solutions, not outcomes. They wanted dark mode, CSV exports, and Slack integration. 

But what they NEEDED was a product that solved their core problem reliably.

We shipped 3 features that addressed the root pain. The other 47? Never built them.

Result: 85% retention after 6 months.

Your job isn't to be a feature factory. It's to be ruthlessly focused on the problem that matters.

Stop collecting feature requests. Start collecting problem statements.

## 5. Mental Model (NEW)
**Purpose**: Teach fundamental thinking tools

### Example Insight:
- **Title**: "Using Jobs-to-be-Done to Clarify Product Direction"
- **Quote**: "When we applied JTBD thinking, we realized users weren't buying project management—they were buying peace of mind"
- **Summary**: JTBD framework revealed the emotional job behind the functional need

### Generated Post:
```
I use the Jobs-to-be-Done framework with every struggling product.

It's simple: People don't buy products. They hire them to do a job.

Recent example: A project management tool with flat growth.

The founder thought the job was "manage projects efficiently."

We interviewed 20 users. The real job? "Look competent in front of my boss."

That insight changed everything:
• Added status report templates
• Built "wins" dashboard for meetings
• Created executive summary views

Growth jumped 3x in 4 months.

**The framework:**
1. What progress is the user trying to make?
2. What's the struggle preventing that progress?
3. What's the moment they realize they need help?

When you understand the job, the features become obvious.

Stop building features. Start solving jobs.

## Implementation Notes

### Identifying These Types in Transcripts

**Contrarian Take indicators:**
- "Most people think X, but..."
- "The common advice is wrong"
- "Everyone's doing X, we did Y instead"
- Challenging industry best practices
- Going against conventional wisdom

**Mental Model indicators:**
- Explaining established frameworks (JTBD, Lean, MoSCoW, etc.)
- "The way to think about this is..."
- Teaching moments about fundamental concepts
- References to systematic approaches
- "I always use this framework..."

### Scoring Considerations

**Contrarian Takes** tend to score high on:
- Urgency (challenges status quo)
- Specificity (clear opposing view)
- Authority (shows expertise)

**Mental Models** tend to score high on:
- Authority (teaching expertise)
- Relatability (universal application)
- Specificity (clear framework)

### Distribution Strategy

Recommended content mix:
- 30% Problem posts (build empathy)
- 25% Proof posts (build credibility)
- 20% Framework posts (build authority)
- 15% Contrarian Takes (build thought leadership)
- 10% Mental Models (build teaching reputation)

This distribution ensures variety while maintaining focus on the core value propositions.
