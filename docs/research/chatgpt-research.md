Best Practices for LinkedIn Text-Only Posts for Coaches and Consultants

LinkedIn has become a powerful platform for coaches and consultants to attract clients and grow their professional following. The key is to consistently share text-only posts that provide value, tell compelling stories, and encourage engagement – all while maintaining a professional yet authentic tone. Below is a structured guide covering writing style, storytelling techniques, post format, timing, engagement tactics, do’s & don’ts, and real-world examples of successful posts.

Writing Style and Tone

Effective LinkedIn posts from coaches and consultants should strike a balance between professional credibility and personal authenticity. Keep the tone professional but personable, as content that shows some personality and honesty tends to resonate more with readers ￼ ￼. Avoid overly formal language or jargon – write in a clear, conversational tone that is easy to digest. Assume the reader isn’t an expert in your topic and explain concepts simply ￼.
	•	Be Authentic and Relatable: Don’t be afraid to share personal experiences or a bit of vulnerability when appropriate. Authentic storytelling humanizes your brand and helps you stand out ￼. For example, opening up about early career mistakes and lessons learned (while framing them as teachable moments) can make your content more relatable. “When I first started in marketing, I made countless mistakes. Here’s what I learned and how you can avoid them,” is a tone that feels genuine and draws readers in ￼.
	•	Maintain a Positive, Expert Voice: Write in an upbeat, encouraging tone and focus on solutions or insights. Even when addressing challenges, frame them constructively. You want to come across as an approachable expert – someone who understands the reader’s problems and can offer guidance. This builds trust without sounding overly salesy or preachy.
	•	Clarity Over Complexity: Use straightforward language and short sentences. Avoid heavy buzzwords or lengthy academic prose. The goal is for a broad audience to grasp your message quickly. Breaking down complex ideas into simple terms demonstrates your expertise and makes the content accessible. Remember that showing you can explain something clearly is more impressive than using big words.
	•	Use a Friendly, Second-Person Style: Write as if you’re speaking to an individual reader (use “you” and “your”). This creates a conversational feel. For instance, a career coach might write, “If you’re feeling stuck in your job, here’s a strategy you can try…” Such direct address keeps readers engaged. Meanwhile, it’s okay to use first person (“I”) when sharing anecdotes or lessons – it adds personality and credibility.

Overall, keep it human. An overly stiff or corporate tone won’t connect on LinkedIn – people engage more with posts that read like one professional helping another, rather than a press release. As one social media expert notes, having a personality isn’t unprofessional on LinkedIn – authenticity and warmth can make your content more relatable and memorable ￼.

Storytelling and Sharing Value

Storytelling is one of the most powerful tools for coaches and consultants on LinkedIn. Rather than just giving generic advice, wrap your insights in a narrative that captivates readers. A well-told story – whether it’s a personal anecdote, a client success story, or a lesson learned – will draw readers in and make your message more impactful.
	•	Start with a Hooking Story or Scenario: Open your post by dropping the reader into an intriguing scenario or emotional moment. This “hook” can be a single sentence or question that piques curiosity (more on hooks in the next section). For example, business coach James Altucher began a viral LinkedIn post with a startling confession: “I want to disappear. I want to move into an old apartment building in a place where I would never talk to anyone.” ￼. This kind of unexpected, human opening stops the scroll and makes people curious why you feel that way, leading them to read more. From there, you can segue into the lesson or insight.
	•	Share Client Success Stories (Social Proof): A powerful approach for coaches is the “client journey” post. Briefly outline a client’s problem, how you helped them overcome it, and the results they achieved ￼. This tells a relatable story and demonstrates your expertise through real outcomes. Emphasize the client’s transformation more than your own role – it feels less like boasting and more like inspiration. For instance, describe the challenges the client faced, the strategy or mindset shift you guided them through, and the positive change (with specifics or metrics if possible). Such success stories both inspire readers and subtly show that you know what you’re doing as a coach ￼.
	•	Teach Through Personal Lessons: Don’t shy away from sharing personal lessons learned in your own career or business. “Lesson posts” that detail a mistake you made, a hurdle you overcame, or a milestone you reached can be very compelling ￼. By telling the story of what happened and what you learned, you invite the audience into your world. This vulnerability builds a connection – it shows you’re human – while also delivering a takeaway the reader can use. The key is to focus on the takeaway: clearly state what you learned or the principle gained from the experience and how it can help others ￼. For example, a leadership consultant might recount a time they handled a team conflict poorly, then explain the leadership lesson gained and how they apply it now. Such storytelling offers wisdom in a relatable format, and positions you as someone who grows and evolves (a quality clients appreciate).
	•	Address Your Audience’s Pain Points with Value: Whether through story or a straight tip list, always frame your content around value to the reader. Identify common challenges your target audience faces – career stagnation, imposter syndrome, scaling a business, etc. – and craft posts that speak to those needs ￼. You might share a mini case study, a “how-to” guide, or a motivational insight that provides hope and direction. Educational content tailored to professionals tends to get high engagement on LinkedIn ￼. Make sure each post has a clear takeaway or piece of advice that the reader finds useful. People are more likely to engage with and share content that teaches them something new or offers a solution to a problem.
	•	Incorporate Emotion and Humanity: Great stories trigger emotion – whether it’s inspiration, empathy, or even humor. Don’t be afraid to let some emotion show in your writing, as long as it’s authentic and ties to your message. For example, celebrating a milestone with genuine gratitude or expressing passion for a cause can resonate strongly. Executive coach Marshall Goldsmith once shared a heartfelt post celebrating his 75th birthday, reflecting on his journey. The community responded with nearly 2,000 comments and 4,000 reactions, joining in his celebration ￼. The lesson: showing joy, pride, gratitude, or even constructive vulnerability can encourage others to engage and feel a personal connection to you.

In summary, tell stories that teach. Whether it’s your story or someone else’s, use narrative to illustrate your points rather than just stating them. This not only makes your posts more engaging but also helps readers internalize the value you’re providing. Every good story post should end with a clear value takeaway or lesson for the audience – ensure the reader walks away with insight, not just a story. Marrying storytelling with actionable advice is a winning formula on LinkedIn ￼ ￼.

Ideal Post Structure and Length

How you structure your LinkedIn text post can greatly impact its readability and reach. LinkedIn’s feed will truncate long posts (usually after 3 lines on desktop or a couple of sentences on mobile) with a “…see more” link, so you need to front-load the interest and format the post for easy reading. Here are structural best practices:
	•	Lead with a Compelling Hook: The first line or two of your post are critical. This is the hook that will determine if someone stops to read or scrolls past. Aim to spark curiosity, surprise, or an emotional reaction immediately ￼. Effective hooks often take the form of a bold statement, a surprising statistic, a provocative question, or a very short anecdote. As noted above, starting with an unusual personal statement (“I want to disappear…”) or a thought-provoking question can entice readers to click “see more” ￼ ￼. Keep the hook very brief – one or two sentences max, or even a single phrase – because if it’s too long, it might get cut off and fail to grab attention ￼. Think of it as a headline for your post. Examples of strong hooks might be: “I almost quit coaching last year. Here’s why I’m glad I didn’t.” or a question like “Ever had a client break down in tears in your office? I have – here’s what it taught me.” Make sure the opening sets up intrigue and hints at the story or insight to come.
	•	Keep Paragraphs Short and Snappy: Format your post in small chunks of text, rather than long paragraphs ￼. A good rule of thumb is 1-3 sentences per paragraph, with a line break in between. Dense blocks of text can overwhelm readers on a screen and may cause them to skip your post. By breaking up the text, you make it more inviting and scannable ￼. In fact, LinkedIn’s algorithm and audience trends now favor a somewhat “long-form” post (several hundred words) that is broken into many bite-sized lines. Many top creators use one or two sentences per line, creating a vertical flow that encourages scrolling. This approach increases “dwell time” (time spent reading) and the likelihood that readers will click “see more” and engage. It’s essentially storytelling in a series of quick, digestible beats.
	•	Optimal Length: Don’t be afraid to write longer posts – LinkedIn users have grown accustomed to reading detailed stories or lists in their feed. The optimal length for a text-only LinkedIn post is around 300–400 words (which is roughly the upper limit before hitting LinkedIn’s character cap for a single post) ￼. Posts under 200 words often see lower reach, whereas longer posts that provide depth tend to perform better ￼. This length allows you to tell a story or list out a series of tips in a meaningful way. That said, every word should add value – avoid filler. If a post runs shorter but makes a strong point, that’s fine. The key is that longer posts succeed when they maintain interest throughout (hence the importance of good storytelling and formatting).
	•	Use Lists or Formatting for Emphasis: If your post contains a series of tips, steps, or examples, consider formatting them as a simple list within the post (using numbers or dashes). Bullet points can make information stand out and look organized in the LinkedIn feed ￼. For example: “3 Tips to Overcome Procrastination: 1) Break tasks into tiny steps… 2) Schedule a ‘distracted time’… 3) Reward yourself for small wins.” Using a list in a post can improve readability and deliver value clearly. Additionally, using ALL CAPS sparingly for a single word or emoji characters to draw attention can add visual interest to a text post ￼. Some professionals incorporate a few relevant emojis (like ✅ or 💡) to emphasize key points or add a friendly touch, but use them judiciously and ensure they fit your brand voice.
	•	Close with a Call-to-Action (CTA): End your post with some form of engagement prompt or next step. Often, the best CTA is a question inviting readers to comment with their experiences or advice (e.g., “What do you think? Have you faced something similar?”) ￼ ￼. This explicitly encourages interaction. You could also prompt a quick action like “Hit 👍 if you found this useful” or “Feel free to share this with a fellow coach who needs to hear it.” For coaches and consultants looking for clients, a subtle CTA can be offering a resource or encouraging direct contact, but do this sparingly so that most posts focus on value rather than self-promotion. For instance: “P.S. I put together a free worksheet on this process – comment or message me if you’d like a copy.” The CTA should feel like a natural extension of the post, not a hard sell. Always make sure you’ve delivered on the value before the CTA, so it comes across as a helpful add-on.

Post Example Structure: To illustrate, a well-structured text-only post might look like: a hook (one captivating line), then a short paragraph setting the context or telling the beginning of a story, then one-sentence-per-line storytelling for the core message or list of tips, and finally a question to invite responses. Throughout, no paragraph is more than a few lines long. This kind of structure maximizes the chances that readers will click “see more,” read till the end, and engage.

Best Times and Frequency to Post

Timing and consistency play a significant role in how many people see your LinkedIn posts. LinkedIn’s audience behavior tends to mirror standard work routines, since it’s a professional network. Here’s what research and data suggest for when and how often coaches and consultants should post:
	•	Optimal Posting Times: Aim to post during mid-week business hours when your target audience is most active. Studies have found that engagement peaks in late morning, especially on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays around 10–11 AM (in your audience’s local time) ￼ ￼. These mid-week days see the highest LinkedIn traffic and interaction as professionals settle into the workweek. For example, one 2025 analysis notes that for company pages, Tuesday through Thursday starting at 10 a.m. (extending a few hours) are ideal, with weekends being much quieter ￼. Early weekdays (Monday) can be slightly less optimal as people catch up on work, and Fridays afternoon tend to see drops as people switch to weekend mode. If you do post on Mondays or Fridays, mid-morning (around 10 AM) is still a good bet ￼. Avoid late nights and weekends for important posts, as LinkedIn usage dips outside work hours. The sweet spot is generally the middle of the workday when people might take breaks and scroll their feed. Of course, you should consider the time zones of your client base – if you have a global audience, you might experiment with multiple time slots. But as a rule, posting in that 10 AM – noon window on weekdays yields strong visibility for most industries ￼.
	•	Posting Frequency: Consistency is crucial on LinkedIn. At a minimum, aim to post at least once per week, as LinkedIn itself has observed that brands (and by extension, individual creators) that post weekly see 2x higher engagement and significantly more follower growth than those who post rarely ￼. For coaches building a personal brand, posting more frequently can accelerate your growth: 2–5 posts per week is a good target to start with, and if you have the content bandwidth, moving up to daily posting can yield even greater results ￼ ￼. In fact, some LinkedIn experts advocate posting every weekday if possible, noting that daily posting keeps your profile visible and helps establish you as a thought leader faster ￼ ￼. Samantha North, a LinkedIn branding expert, credits daily posting with expanding her network and reach substantially over time ￼ ￼. However, quality trumps quantity – it’s better to do 3 highly valuable posts a week than 7 mediocre ones. If you choose daily posting, ensure you have genuinely useful content each time, or you risk audience fatigue.
	•	Spacing and Algorithm Considerations: LinkedIn’s algorithm does not favor posting multiple times per day in quick succession. In fact, it’s recommended to leave at least 12-18 hours between posts for best results ￼. Posting too frequently (several times a day) can cause your own posts to compete with each other for visibility and may be seen as spammy. A good practice is to post, then spend time engaging with comments on that post and engaging with others’ content, rather than immediately posting again. This cadence allows each post to breathe and gather engagement in its “golden hour” (the first hour or two after posting) without distraction ￼ ￼. Consistency is more important than volume – stick to a realistic schedule (e.g., every Tuesday/Thursday, or Mon-Wed-Fri, or daily on weekdays) and your audience will come to anticipate and appreciate your content.
	•	Leverage Analytics and Adjust: While general best times are a helpful starting point, it’s wise to pay attention to your own post analytics. LinkedIn’s native analytics or third-party tools can show when your audience is most active. You might notice, for example, that your particular followers engage more in the afternoon or that Monday actually works well for your niche. Use those insights to fine-tune your posting schedule ￼. As a baseline, though, posting consistently during weekday mornings/middays is a reliable strategy to maximize reach.

In summary, post regularly and at the right times. A consistent drumbeat of content – ideally a few times a week or more – keeps you on your audience’s radar and signals to LinkedIn that you’re an active contributor (which can indirectly help your content get shown more). Pair that with strategic timing (mid-week mornings) to catch people when they’re looking at LinkedIn, and you’ll greatly increase your chances of engagement on each post ￼ ￼.

Engagement Tips: CTAs, Hashtags, and Commenting Strategy

Creating great content is only half the battle – you also want to encourage engagement (likes, comments, shares) to broaden your reach and build relationships. LinkedIn values meaningful interactions, so fostering engagement will not only amplify your post in the feed (as more engagement leads to more visibility), but also help you connect with potential clients. Here are key tactics for boosting engagement on text-only posts:
	•	Always Include a Call-to-Action (CTA) or Question: One of the golden rules of LinkedIn content is to invite the audience to participate. A simple way to do this is by ending your post with a question or prompt. In fact, asking a thoughtful closing question is considered a best practice because it opens the floor for discussion and lets your followers chime in ￼ ￼. For example, after sharing your insights or story, you might ask, “Have you experienced something similar?”, “What’s your take on this issue?”, or “What strategy has worked for you in this situation?” ￼. People love to share their own expertise and opinions, especially if you directly ask – this significantly increases the likelihood of comments ￼. You can also encourage other forms of engagement: e.g., “If you found this useful, let me know below or leave a 👍.” But questions tend to work best for sparking conversation. Make sure the question is related and sincere – a genuine query that you actually want to hear answers to (avoid gimmicky or unrelated questions). By consistently ending posts with a relevant question, you train your audience that you welcome their input, which boosts interaction.
	•	Use Hashtags Strategically: Hashtags on LinkedIn help categorize your content and make it discoverable to people beyond your immediate network. For coaches and consultants, using a few relevant hashtags can extend your reach to users following or searching those topics. Best practice is to include around 3–5 hashtags per post (overloading with too many can look spammy and LinkedIn may penalize reach if you use, say, 10+ hashtags) ￼. Choose hashtags that align with your content and target audience interests. For example, a leadership coach might use #LeadershipDevelopment, #CareerGrowth, or #CoachingTips. In one real example, business consultant Daniel Goleman wrote about emotional intelligence and the rise of AI, and he used hashtags like #AI and #emotionalintelligence to reach people interested in those topics ￼. This helped his post gain wider visibility and spark a lively discussion. The key is to make them specific enough to attract the right crowd (e.g., #MindsetShift or #SmallBusinessTips rather than extremely broad ones like #success). Often, placing the hashtags at the end of your post is cleanest, or you can naturally integrate one or two within sentences if it reads well. Using a consistent branded hashtag for your own content (like your company or slogan) is optional, but focus first on commonly followed tags in your niche to maximize exposure.
	•	Encourage Comments and Respond Promptly: Engagement is a two-way street. If you invite comments, be prepared to actively engage back. When people reply to your post, make an effort to respond to as many comments as you can – especially within the first hour or two of posting when the algorithm is watching for engagement momentum ￼ ￼. Acknowledge compliments, answer questions, and thank people for their input. This not only boosts the current post (LinkedIn favors content with robust comment threads), but also builds rapport with your audience. Experts advise sticking around after you publish: “I normally stick around for at least an hour after publishing so I can reply to any early comments. Doing this tends to give the post an initial boost.” ￼. Moreover, seeing you actively respond encourages more people to comment (they know their contribution will be valued). Fostering conversation in the comments can significantly increase a post’s reach, as the ongoing interaction signals to LinkedIn that your content is generating meaningful discussion. In short, don’t post and ghost – post and participate.
	•	Leverage the Power of LinkedIn’s Community: Beyond your own posts, a great engagement strategy is to be an active commenter on others’ posts in your field. This can indirectly attract attention to your profile and posts. For instance, leave thoughtful comments on industry influencers’ posts or on discussions where your target clients hang out. These comments act as “mini-posts” showcasing your expertise and can entice people to check out your profile (and thereby see your posts) ￼. Also, when relevant, you can tag individuals in your post – but use @mentions sparingly and only if the content is directly relevant to those people (tagging random people just to get their attention is considered spammy and can hurt your post’s quality score ￼). If you have collaborators or someone you’re quoting, an @mention can increase the post’s reach to their network as well, provided they engage with it.
	•	Avoid External Links in Posts: This might seem counterintuitive for engagement, but it’s important: do not include external links in the body of your text post. LinkedIn’s algorithm generally deprioritizes posts that might send users off-platform (i.e., anything with a link out to a website) ￼. Studies and anecdotal evidence show that posts with a link often get dramatically lower reach and engagement ￼. If you need to share a link (to a blog, a video, a sign-up page, etc.), a common tactic is to post your text content without the link, and then add the link in a comment below (and you can mention in your post “link in the comments” if necessary) ￼. This way your post can perform well, and those interested can still find the link in the comments. Alternatively, use LinkedIn’s native article feature or document uploads for content you want to share (since those keep users on LinkedIn). Keeping your text-only posts truly text-only (native content) will ensure maximum reach.
	•	Balance Use of Engagement Features: LinkedIn offers other features like polls or celebrating occasions which can drive engagement. Since we’re focusing on text posts, consider occasionally asking a simple question in a post that might have been a poll – this can work similarly to drive quick engagement (e.g., “Yes or no: Should you ever work for free to gain experience? Comment with Yes/No and why.”). Also, if someone leaves a great comment, do not hesitate to reply and even hit “Like” or “Insightful” on their comment – these small actions encourage that person (and others) to continue the discussion. Showing that you value community feedback can turn commenters into conversations.

Summary of Engagement Tactics: In every post, have a clear engagement prompt (usually a closing question). Use a few relevant hashtags to broaden reach beyond your network. Once the post is live, be highly responsive in the comments, especially early on, to boost visibility. Avoid anything (like external links or spammy tags) that the algorithm frowns upon ￼ ￼. Over time, consistently engaging with your audience will train the algorithm to show your posts more widely and cultivate a loyal following who actively interacts with your content.

Do’s and Don’ts

When crafting LinkedIn posts as a coach or consultant, keep these fundamental do’s and don’ts in mind to ensure your content builds your credibility and engages your audience, rather than undermining it.

Key Do’s
	•	Do provide value above all: Before hitting “post,” ask yourself if the content teaches, inspires, or genuinely helps your target audience. Prioritize sharing useful tips, insights, and stories that highlight your expertise and address your audience’s needs ￼ ￼. Consistently providing value will establish you as a go-to resource and thought leader in your niche.
	•	Do keep it professional in content: While tone can be casual, ensure your topics and language reflect a professional context. It’s great to be personable, but posts should still align with your personal brand and industry. Stick mostly to subjects relevant to your coaching/consulting domain and avoid oversharing personal life details that don’t tie back to a lesson or professional point ￼. This keeps your content focused and your credibility high.
	•	Do use a clear, readable format: Make your posts easy on the eyes. Use short paragraphs, line breaks, or lists to break up text ￼ ￼. A well-formatted post is more likely to be read fully. Also, pay attention to spelling and grammar – you want to come across as polished and articulate (minor typos are human, but consistent sloppy writing can hurt your professional image).
	•	Do use compelling hooks and storytelling: Start strong and use narrative elements throughout your posts. A great opening line and engaging story will dramatically improve your post’s performance. Remember that LinkedIn favors posts that capture attention (e.g., via “see more” clicks and dwell time), so put effort into your intro and storytelling flow ￼ ￼.
	•	Do engage with your network: Encourage feedback (through CTAs/questions) and when people respond, interact with them. Respond to comments consistently to build relationships and demonstrate that you’re present and listening ￼ ￼. Also, support others by commenting on their posts – it’s a two-way community.
	•	Do be consistent and patient: Building an audience takes time. Commit to a regular posting schedule that you can sustain. Even if some posts get little engagement at first, stick with it and keep refining your approach. Over time, consistency plus quality will pay off. As one expert puts it, virality on LinkedIn often requires “time and experimentation (and a little luck)”, so be patient and keep learning from each post ￼.

Key Don’ts
	•	Don’t treat LinkedIn like Facebook or Twitter: Avoid overly personal or frivolous content that isn’t relevant to your professional audience. Posts about your weekend fun, polarizing rants, or meme-style jokes (unless cleverly tied to a business lesson) can backfire on LinkedIn. One common mistake is sharing content better suited for casual social networks – this can detract from your professional insight and harm your credibility ￼. Keep updates focused on professional growth, career, industry trends, success stories, etc., rather than private life dramas or unrelated memes.
	•	Don’t constantly self-promote or hard-sell: It’s fine to mention your services or achievements occasionally, but if every post reads like an advertisement (“Sign up for my program!” “Buy my book!”), people will tune out. Follow the 80/20 rule – about 80% of your content should be pure value (educational or inspirational), and no more than 20% direct promotion. Even when you do promote something (a webinar, course, etc.), frame it in terms of the benefit to the reader and keep the tone helpful rather than salesy ￼ ￼. Authenticity and generosity build trust, whereas constant selling can erode it.
	•	Don’t use clickbait or misleading hooks: While a strong hook is important, make sure it’s honest and relevant to the rest of your post. Don’t bait readers with shock value or dramatic claims that you don’t actually address in the content. This can frustrate your audience and hurt your reputation. It’s better to have a slightly less sensational hook that delivers on its promise than a sensational one that leads to a letdown. Be intriguing, but also be truthful.
	•	Don’t overuse tags and hashtags: Tagging dozens of people or slapping 10+ hashtags on every post is counterproductive. LinkedIn may flag excessive tagging as spam (especially if those tagged aren’t likely to respond) ￼. Only tag individuals who are directly relevant to the conversation and likely to engage. Similarly, stick to a handful of well-chosen hashtags rather than a laundry list. Quality of tags over quantity – otherwise your post can look desperate for attention or get dinged by the algorithm.
	•	Don’t include external links in the post body: As mentioned, putting links to external websites or videos in your post text will significantly reduce its reach ￼. LinkedIn’s algorithm wants to keep users on the platform ￼. If you need to share a link, use the comments or LinkedIn’s native article feature. Posts that say “link in comments” might add a tiny extra step for readers, but they’ll get shown to far more people than posts with a link embedded.
	•	Don’t ignore engagement (or lack thereof): If people are commenting, do not ignore them – engage back (that’s a “do,” as above). Conversely, if you consistently get little to no engagement, don’t keep doing the same thing. Avoid the mistake of posting content that you find interesting but your audience doesn’t – pay attention to which posts resonate (via views, likes, comments) and which don’t. It might be a sign to adjust your topics, format, or timing. For instance, if pure text advice posts get crickets but personal story posts get responses, lean more into storytelling. Adapt based on feedback and data; don’t stubbornly stick to a format that isn’t working.

Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure your LinkedIn presence grows in a positive direction. It’s about showcasing your expertise and personality professionally, without falling into common traps that diminish credibility or reduce reach. Keep it value-driven, audience-centric, and aligned with the norms of the LinkedIn community for the best results.

Examples of Successful Text-Only Posts by Coaches & Consultants

Nothing illustrates these principles better than real examples. Here are a few real-world LinkedIn text posts by coaches/consultants that performed exceptionally well, and why they worked:
	•	The Intriguing Personal Story – James Altucher (Business Coach): James Altucher, a well-known entrepreneur and coach, wrote a text-only post titled “10 Steps To Avoid Giving Up” that went viral. It started with a powerful hook – “I want to disappear. I want to move into an old apartment building in a place where I would never talk to anyone.” ￼. This raw, unexpected opening immediately grabbed attention and drove readers to click “see more.” In the post, Altucher mixed a personal, vulnerable story of his own struggles with practical, step-by-step advice (the “10 steps” promised in the title) ￼. The balance of emotional storytelling and actionable tips made it highly shareable. Readers were moved by the honesty and found the advice useful – a combination that led to high engagement. Key lesson: A unique first-line hook plus genuine story + clear advice = a post that people stop to read and feel compelled to like/comment on. Altucher’s post shows the impact of breaking the typical LinkedIn mold and delivering something real and valuable.
	•	Celebratory Milestone with Emotion – Marshall Goldsmith (Executive Coach): Marshall Goldsmith, a renowned executive coach, garnered huge engagement by sharing a personal milestone – his 75th birthday. In that text post, Goldsmith reflected on his journey, thanked his network, and shared his excitement for what’s ahead. The post struck a chord because it felt like a community celebration rather than self-congratulation. It collected almost 4,000 reactions and 2,000 comments ￼, as people chimed in to offer congratulations and appreciation for his influence. Goldsmith’s tone was warm and humble, focusing on gratitude and lessons from his career. Why it worked: It combined a positive personal update (which humanizes a public figure) with a professional context (decades of impact as a coach). It invited followers to celebrate with him, and people love to rally around positive news. Coaches can take note – sharing your wins or milestones, especially framed in terms of gratitude or a lesson learned, can greatly boost engagement and strengthen your bond with your audience. Just remember to keep the focus on the meaning behind the milestone (e.g. what you learned, who you’re thankful for) rather than just “look at me.”
	•	Hot Industry Topic + Expert Take – Daniel Goleman (Business Consultant): Daniel Goleman, famous for his work on emotional intelligence, created a thought-provoking text post discussing how AI (a hot trend) intersects with human connection in coaching. This post did very well because Goleman tapped into a current hot topic (artificial intelligence) and provided his expert perspective on it, which was highly relevant to his niche of emotional intelligence coaching ￼. He posed an interesting question about where AI fits into human-centric coaching, prompting a lot of commentary. Importantly, he also used a couple of hashtags effectively (#AI, #emotionalintelligence) to reach a broader audience following those topics ￼. The post sparked an active discussion with many comments and shares, as it touched on a timely debate and invited opinions. Insight: By weighing in on trending conversations (in a way that relates to your field) and asking your network for their thoughts, you can create viral text posts. Just ensure you add something unique or insightful rather than a generic take. Goleman’s example also highlights the smart use of hashtags to boost discoverability among relevant audiences.
	•	Championing a Cause – Sallie Krawcheck (Entrepreneurial Coach): Sallie Krawcheck, CEO and co-founder of a women-centric financial company, often posts about causes she’s passionate about that align with her brand (such as women’s financial empowerment). In one high-performing text post, she celebrated a major company achievement – Ellevest raising $53 million in funding – and tied it to her mission of helping women build wealth ￼. The post’s text was passionate and bold, underlining why that funding mattered for women’s financial futures. It resonated strongly because it wasn’t just a dry business update; it carried a larger message of progress for a cause her audience cares about. People love sharing content that makes them feel good or supports a positive mission. Her authentic enthusiasm and the clear relevance to her niche made the post highly shareable ￼. Takeaway: If you have a cause or core value integral to your coaching, don’t hesitate to speak about it and celebrate wins related to it. Posts that combine social impact with professional news can generate a lot of goodwill and engagement, as your followers feel like they’re part of something meaningful by interacting with your content.

Each of these examples illustrates a few common themes: strong openings, personal or timely subject matter, clear value or emotion, and a tone that invites the community in. As a coach or consultant, you can emulate these successes by posting your own versions: share your striking stories and lessons, celebrate your human moments, comment on industry trends, and champion what you believe in. Keep it text-only and substantive, and you can achieve excellent reach and follower growth even without graphics or videos.

In conclusion, crafting effective text-only LinkedIn posts is about delivering expertise in an engaging wrapper. Use a compelling writing style that’s authentic yet professional, tell stories that provide value, structure your posts for easy reading, post when your audience is online (and post consistently), and actively encourage and participate in engagement. Steer clear of pitfalls like spammy practices or off-brand content, and study successful examples for inspiration. By following these best practices, coaches and consultants can create LinkedIn posts that not only attract more clients but also foster a community of followers who trust and amplify their message. Implement these strategies, and over time you’ll likely see growing engagement, stronger relationships, and tangible business results from your LinkedIn presence. Good luck, and happy posting!  ￼ ￼
